# Markdown Previewer

This is the first project for Free Code Camp's Data Visualization certificate.

Completed On: 14 November 2016
Last Updated: 08 February 2016

## Objectives

Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.

**Rule #1**: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.

**Rule #2**: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**Rule #3**: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.

## User Stories

- I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
- I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
